# Smart Workflow User Guide - Adaptive Data Collection System

## Overview

The Smart Workflow is the intelligent, automated approach to data collection that leverages cloud platform APIs and machine learning to minimize manual effort while maximizing data quality. This guide walks you through using the Smart Workflow for efficient asset discovery and migration assessment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Active account with appropriate permissions
- Access to target cloud platform (AWS, Azure, GCP) or on-premises environment
- Platform credentials configured (API keys, service accounts, etc.)

### When to Use Smart Workflow
- **Modern Cloud Environments**: Your applications run on AWS, Azure, or GCP with API access
- **Automated Discovery**: You want to minimize manual data entry
- **Large Portfolios**: You need to assess 50+ applications efficiently
- **Real-time Data**: You require up-to-date asset information
- **Compliance Requirements**: You need detailed audit trails and data lineage

## Starting a Smart Workflow

### Step 1: Initiate Collection Flow

1. **Navigate to Discovery Dashboard**
   - From the main navigation, click "Discovery"
   - Select "Start New Assessment" 
   - Choose "Smart Workflow (Automated Collection)"

2. **Environment Selection**
   - Select your primary platform: AWS, Azure, GCP, or On-Premises

3. **Quality Score Calculation**
   ```
   Data Quality Score = (Completeness × 0.4) + 
                       (Accuracy × 0.3) + 
                       (Consistency × 0.2) + 
                       (Freshness × 0.1)
   ```

### Performance Issues
- **Issue**: Slow discovery or timeouts
- **Solution**: Reduce parallelism, increase timeout values, schedule during off-peak hours

### Data Quality Concerns
- **Issue**: Low quality scores or confidence levels
- **Solution**: Enable additional validation sources, manual verification of critical data, expert review

## Integration with Traditional Workflow

The Smart Workflow can seamlessly transition to Traditional Workflow when needed:

- **Hybrid Approach**: Combine automated discovery with manual validation
- **Gap Filling**: Use traditional methods for data not discoverable via APIs
- **Validation**: Manual verification of automated results
- **Legacy Systems**: Fall back to manual collection for older applications

## Next Steps

After completing Smart Workflow data collection:

1. **Review Results**: Validate discovered data with stakeholders
2. **Address Gaps**: Complete any remaining manual data collection
3. **Begin Analysis**: Transition to 6R strategy assessment
4. **Plan Migration**: Use collected data for detailed migration planning

The Smart Workflow provides the foundation for data-driven migration decisions, ensuring you have comprehensive, accurate information for successful cloud migration strategies.
