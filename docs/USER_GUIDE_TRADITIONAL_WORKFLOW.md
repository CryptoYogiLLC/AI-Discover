# Traditional Workflow User Guide - Adaptive Data Collection System

## Overview

The Traditional Workflow provides a structured, manual approach to data collection when automated discovery is not feasible or requires human validation. This workflow is ideal for air-gapped environments, legacy systems, or situations requiring detailed business context that cannot be automatically discovered.

## When to Use Traditional Workflow

### Optimal Use Cases
- **Air-Gapped Environments**: No external connectivity or API access
- **Legacy Systems**: Older applications without modern monitoring or APIs
- **High-Security Environments**: Strict access controls preventing automated scanning
- **Business Context Required**: Need for business rules, processes, and stakeholder input
- **Compliance Constraints**: Regulatory requirements preventing automated discovery
- **Mixed Environments**: Combination of discoverable and non-discoverable systems

### Environment Types
- **Tier 4 (Air-Gapped)**: Primary workflow for completely isolated environments
- **Tier 3 (Restricted)**: Supplementary workflow for systems with limited API access
- **Hybrid Scenarios**: Validation and gap-filling for Smart Workflow results
