## User Stories

### Data Collection Workflow

**US-001**: As a Migration Analyst, I want the system to automatically discover and collect asset data from my cloud environment so that I can minimize manual data entry.

**US-002**: As a Portfolio Manager, I want to bulk-upload application data via spreadsheet so that I can efficiently process large application portfolios.

**US-003**: As a Security Administrator, I want to deploy the collection system on-premises so that I can maintain data sovereignty and compliance.

**US-004**: As a Migration Consultant, I want the system to identify missing data gaps so that I can focus my time on collecting the most critical information.

**US-005**: As an Enterprise Architect, I want to iteratively refine application data so that I can improve recommendation accuracy over time.

### Assessment Workflow

**US-006**: As a Migration Analyst, I want the system to generate 6R recommendations with confidence scores so that I can prioritize data collection efforts.

**US-007**: As a Portfolio Manager, I want to compare recommendation confidence across applications so that I can allocate analysis resources effectively.

**US-008**: As a Migration Consultant, I want guided questionnaires for missing data so that I can efficiently complete assessments.

## Business Rules

### BR-Rule-001: Data Collection Prioritization

- Critical 6R decision factors must be collected before optional metadata
- Applications with higher business value receive priority for detailed analysis
- Missing data that impacts recommendation confidence triggers mandatory collection

### BR-Rule-002: Automation Fallback Logic

- System attempts highest tier automation available in environment
- Automatic fallback to lower tiers when automation fails
- Manual collection always available as final fallback option

### BR-Rule-003: Confidence Thresholds

- Minimum 60% confidence required for initial 6R recommendations
- Minimum 85% confidence required for final migration planning
- Mandatory gap resolution below confidence thresholds

### BR-Rule-004: Data Retention and Privacy

- Personal data anonymization for multi-tenant environments
- Client data isolation with tenant-specific encryption keys
- Configurable data retention periods based on client requirements

## Dependencies and Constraints

### Technical Dependencies

- Existing Migration UI Orchestrator platform architecture
- Multi-tenant database infrastructure
- AI/ML services for gap analysis and questionnaire generation
- Cloud platform APIs (AWS, Azure, GCP) for automated collection

### Business Constraints

- Client security policies may restrict API access
